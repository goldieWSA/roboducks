                        As a team, we have a challenge to address the problem of ocean pollution. We are working on a solution that would help reduce the amount of plastic waste in the ocean.
                        We took inspiration from the <i>Ocean Cleanup Project</i>, which was a successful project that reduced the amount of plastic waste in the ocean by 80%. The <i>Ocean Cleanup Project</i> discovered that over 70% of the trash in the Pacific Garbage Patch comes from only ten rivers, so we decided to hit the problem at the source.
                        We decided to create a gadget that can attach to the back of kayaks or other boats, and as the user paddles the boat, the gadget will automatically collect plastic waste.

                        We improved from last time, adding a modular attachment system to the robot. This makes it easier to add and remove attachments from the robot.
                        We also reused Mission 11 (the tower) from last year's FLL Masterpiece Challenge to make our first attachment, a forklift desgin.
                        The image for the current forklift design is from a few weeks ago, and we've actually changed our design in those few weeks, so the image for the forklift design is slightly outdated.
